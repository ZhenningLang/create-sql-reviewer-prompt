# create-sql-reviewer-prompt

A prompt to review create sql

Tested on OpenAi GPT-4

- [Chinese Version](/prompt.chn.txt)
- [English Version](/prompt.eng.txt)

In my own test, using a single prompt often fails to provide a satisfactory overall review result.

However, some of the results are still useful.

## Why I do this

As a senior engineer, one of my daily tasks is to review the Create SQL of my colleagues.

Most of the time, there are many obvious issues, which wastes a lot of my life.

So, I write this prompt. 

Next time this happens again, I will throw the prompt at them and have them check it themselves first.
